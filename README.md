# PHP-MajorProject-FinalYear-FreelancingWebsite
This is a website which I had created during my final year project submission. Where user or freelancers registers themselves to search or request needed jobs of their interest. And any project or job can also be added by the companies who are looking for respective candidates who can willingly complete the projects provided.

Need to update all files. As it is a working website which I had created.
